        <h2 class="content-head content-head-ribbon">Bandi â€¦ what?</h2>

        <p><b>Banditore</b> is an italian word. It means a <i>town crier</i> (or in french <i>un crieur public</i>).</p>
        <p>Wikipedia says: "<i>A town crier, or bellman, is an officer of the court who makes public pronouncements as required by the court </i>".</p>
        <p>
            We are not in court here but I think you get the idea. Banditore will makes "announcements" about new releases from repositories you starred.
            On every new release (or tag, because some people don't use the Release feature) it'll push a new item right away in your RSS feed.
        </p>

    <h2 class="content-head is-center">How it works</h2>

    <div class=" l-box-lrg pure-g">
        <div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2 pure-u-lg-3-5">
            <h4>Retrieve starred repositories from your Github account</h4>
            <p>
                When you first login, we retrieve minimal information from you (name, username &amp; avatar).
                Then we fetch your stars &amp; their associated repository.
            </p>

            <h4>Periodically retrieve new release &amp; tag</h4>
            <p>
                At least twice per hour, we retrieve new release or tag for your repository using your token.
                Once we have gathered all these information, we build a feed with them, ordered by published date of each release.
            </p>

            <h4>Markdown<i>ified</i> content</h4>
            <p>
                Some release contains markdown information which will be converted in HTML for a better rendering.
                For tag (which doesn't come with a body), we'll only display the tag name.
            </p>

            <h4>Do you want to improve it?</h4>
            <p>
                As I said, Banditore is <a href="https://github.com/j0k3r/banditore">open source</a>.
                If something bother you or if you want to improve it, I'll be much happy to check your issue or review your PR!
